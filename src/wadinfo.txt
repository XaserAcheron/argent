Description             : ARGENT is the streamlined Doom 4 Mod, bringing
                          Neccronixis's Doom 4 weapon sprites to life with
                          an old-school flair. It brings weapon mods,
                          smooth animations, delicious gibs, and a zillion
                          options to the table, all without straying too
                          far from the Classic Doom formula.

* Gameplay Notes *

ARGENT, in a nutshell, is a unique spin on the "Doom 4 in Doom" concept.
In contrast to the other big kids on the block (D4D & D4T), ARGENT aims
to be a bit more "old-school". It's got a sweet set of smoothly-animated
d44m weaponry, but it doesn't introducing a ton of game-changing mechanics.

Some key features:
- All weapons from Doom-Notfour's campaign, quasi-faithfully translated
  and balanced for use against Doom's classic bestiary*.
- Weapon Mods!
- New powerups! Quad, Haste, and Regen are all toggle-able in the menu.
- Equipment! Recharging grenades! Siphons/holograms... eventually! :P
- A custom gib system for maximum "splooshiness"
- Several tweak options for user customization, including the fabled
  "monsters always gib" setting.
- Gallons of polish (or litres if you prefer), particularly in the
  animation department.

[*...okay, I'll admit it -- you're a bit more powerful than
the standard Doomguy. But not gamebreakingly so.]

Note that there are a few things that the mod explicitly does NOT feature:
- Glory Kills
- 100% new-Doom accuracy
- Enemy sprites or behavior changes (gibs being the exception)
- Excessive Randomization
- Incremental weapon/stat upgrades or currency systems
- Belching lava

[For the last one, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbGh9nedu80 --
this is clearly the most important missing feature ;]

===========================================================================
* Weapon Mods *

As listed above, weapon mods (in the Doom 4 sense, not just the ZDoom
sense) are a thing. To get one, pick up a Mod Kit (replaces Backpack)
and use it from your inventory to bring up the Mod Menu.

This isn't a "menu" in the traditional sense, rather, you navigate
it by _switching weapons_; it allows you to "purchase" mods for
whichever weapon you currently have selected (if applicable; the
SSG and pistol, for instance, have no mods).

Once you've decided on a mod, press Fire to "buy" the left one,
or Altfire to "buy" the right one; it will attached immediately.

When you have both mods for a weapon, press the "Reload" key (renamed
to "Switch Weapon Mod" in the ARGENT Options menu) to swap 'em.

When the Mod Menu is open, you can also purchase Equipment
(e.g. grenades) or a Backpack by pressing the "Switch Weapon Mod"
key to flip to the other page of the "shop". As before, use Fire or
Altfire to select one of the two.

Just like in Doom the Fourth itself, equipment "ammo" recharges after a
set amount of time, and you can "purchase" equipment more than once,
increasing the maximum amount you can carry (these recharge too, though
the rate of recharge isn't increased when you buy more). Want to
rain grenades? Just buy a whole bunch! Nothing could possibly go wrong! ;)

===========================================================================
* Options *

Check out the "ARGENT Options" menu (accessible from the main menu) for a
variety of user customizations. Here's a quick overview of the options:

BFG Style:
   Changes the BFG's behavior. There are two options:
 - "Classic": Classic Doom's  BFG9000 in all its glory. Works the same.
 - "Modern" : Emits tracers radially on impact, and zaps enemies with
              cracklin' green lightning when the projectile is in flight.

BFG Ammo Type:
 - "Cells": The BFG shares ammunition with the plasma gun. Classic shots
            use 40 cells; Modern shots use 80 since they're more powerful.
 - "BFG Cells": The BFG uses its own ammotype, which replaces Cell Packs.
                BFG Cell pickups will also grant a small amount of Cells.

Monsters Always Gib:
   Pretty self-explanatory. Give it a try -- you know you want to. ;)

Powerup Toggles:
   ARGENT inclues three new powerups (Quad Damage, Haste, and Regen),
   which can optionally replace a few of Doom's existing powerups.

HUD Style:
 - "Classic": Classic Doom's statusbar & ZDoom's fullscreen HUD. 'Nuff said.
 - "Modern" : A stylized version of Doom 4's HUD in a cool blue hue.

SSG Sprite Style:
   Selects between two sets of SSG sprites (both by Neccronixis):
   the original one used in earlier versions of ARGENT, or the newer,
   more D44M-accurate one. The weapon behaves identically either way.

Mod Controls:
   For ease of use, all of ARGENT's new-ish keybinds (and their neighbors)
   are presented here. This is mostly just a convenience thing, really.

===========================================================================
* Future Plans *

As a 1.0.0 release, there are still a few not-yet-done-but-planned things
(presuming the author doesn't get perpetually busy, which is likely), e.g.:
- Holograms n' Siphons -- Grenades are in, but that's not the end of it.
- Cool Crosshairs, complete with cooldown meters and all that jazz.
- Better Haste and Berserk powerups
- Misc tweaks and bugfixes (of course)
- An expansion pack featuring reinterpreted versions of the MP-exclusive
  weapons (e.g. static rifle and company)... with mods!

When will future releases happen? Who knows? :P
